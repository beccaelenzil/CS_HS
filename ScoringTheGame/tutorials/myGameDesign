My game will be a fishing simulator. The first scene will likely just show the fisherman
walking to the lake. No interaction, just for the music. The second, and main scene, will
involve the player, who stands on a dock in the top left, casting a lure into the lake. The
underwater view of the lake will consume most of the screen. There will be a fish moving
around randomly in the water until a sinking lure hits it, at which point it will latch on.
While the fish is hooked, I hope to use real physics to simulate the stretch and breaking
point of the fishing line, as the user reels or lets out line, and the fish continues to move
in a new random direction every 3 seconds. Even though the premise of game is really boring,
we will ironically use super hype-y music throughout. There are lots of sound effect opportunities,
such as splashing, reeling, breaking line, flopping on dock. The goal of the game for the user is
to reel the fish all the way in to the dock without the line breaking and the fish getting away.
